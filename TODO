make test a path that goes up and down
    make evaluation count the number of pellets collected
    add neurons for being left or right of the pellet
#add weight for connections between neurons

#add better abstraction, make the lizard "run" for a given time and input, this way it can reset itself
#have it optionally generate an output file of its movments!

#verify that brain is properly reset after each run
investigate better display framework, what does carykh use?
    add camera
    add linegraph, fittness over time
        top 500
        number 1
        median
make neuron connection represenation a list of connections, current is model is limited
mutation should have a chance to add or delete connections, not just reassign them
also have a chance to add new neurons 

NOTE:
    there appears to be some critical number of neurons--less and the creatures seem to be barely alive, they move but only lethargically.
    also, at this low level (500 neurons and 5 connections) the histo seemed to be stuck in a loop, all creatures staying at same position with one oscilating
